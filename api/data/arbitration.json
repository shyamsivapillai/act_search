one arbitrator, the signatures of the\r\nmajority of all the members of the arbitral tribunal shall be sufficient so\r\nlong as the reason for any omitted signature is stated.(3) The arbitral award shall state the reasons\r\nupon which it is based, unless -(a)  the \r\nparties have agreed that no reasons are to be given, or(b)  the \r\naward is an arbitral award on agreed terms under section 30.(4) The arbitral award shall state its date\r\nand the place of arbitration as determined in accordance with section 20 and\r\nthe award shall be deemed to have been made at that place.(5) After the arbitral award is made, a signed\r\ncopy shall be delivered to each party.(6) The arbitral tribunal may, at any time\r\nduring the arbitral proceedings, make an interim arbitral award on any matter\r\nwith respect to which it may make a final arbitral award.(7) (a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties,\r\nwhere and in so far as an arbitral award is for the payment of money, the\r\narbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made interest,\r\nat such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for\r\nthe whole or any part of the period between the date on which the cause of\r\naction arose and the date on which the award is made.(b) A sum directed to\r\nbe paid by an arbitral award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry\r\ninterest at the rate of eighteen per centum per annum from the date of the\r\naward to the date of payment.(8) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, -(a)  the \r\ncosts of an arbitration shall be fixed by the arbitral tribunal;(b)  the \r\narbitral tribunal shall specify -( i )\r\n the  party entitled to costs,(ii)  the  party who shall pay the costs,(iii)  the  amount of costs or method of determining that amount,\r\nand(iv)  the  manner in which the costs shall be paid.Explanation:\r\nFor the purpose of\r\nclause (a), \"costs\" means reasonable costs relating to -( i )  the  fees and expenses of the arbitrators and witnesses,(ii)  legal  fees and\r\nexpenses,(iii)  any \r\nadministration fees of the institution supervising the arbitration, and(iv)  any  other\r\nexpenses incurred in connection with the arbitral proceedings and the arbitral\r\naward.Comment: Thus, the law on the award, as governed by\r\nthe new Act, is other way about of the preexisting law; it mandates that the\r\naward should state the reasons upon which it is based. In other words, unless\r\n(a) the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given or (b) the award is\r\nan arbitral award on agreed terms under Section 30 of the New Act, the award\r\nshould state the reasons in support of determination of the\r\nliability/non-liability. Thereby, legislature has not accepted the ratio of the\r\nConstitution Bench in the  Chokhamal  Contractor's case\r\n(AIR 1990 SC 1426), that the award, being in the private law field, need not be\r\na speaking award even where the award relates to the contract of private parties\r\nor between person and the Government or public sector undertakings.
