be made or bills may be discounted or\r\npurchased by the corresponding new bank;(k) the persons or authorities who shall\r\nadminister any pension, provident or other fund constituted for the benefit of\r\nofficers or other employees of the corresponding new bank or their dependants;(l) the preparation and submission of\r\nstatements of programmes of activities and financial statements of the\r\ncorresponding new bank and the period for which and the time within which such\r\nstatements and estimates are to be prepared and submitted; and(m) generally for the efficient conduct of the\r\naffairs of the corresponding new bank.(3) Until any regulation is made under sub-section (1), the\r\narticles of association of the existing bank and every regulation, rule,\r\nbye-law or order made by the existing bank shall, if in force at the\r\ncommencement of this Act, be deemed to be the regulations made under\r\nsub-section (1) and shall have effect accordingly and any reference therein to\r\nany authority of the existing bank shall be deemed to be a reference to the\r\ncorresponding authority of the corresponding new bank and until any such\r\ncorresponding authority is constituted under this Act, shall be deemed to refer\r\nto the Custodian. Comment  : But mere reference to the rule, even if\r\nit mentions grounds for compulsory retirement, cannot be regarded as sufficient\r\nfor treating the order of compulsory retirement as an order of punishment. In\r\nsuch a case, the order can be said to have been passed in terms of the rule\r\nand, therefore, a different intention cannot be inferred. So also, if the\r\nstatement in the order refers only to the assessment of his work and does not\r\nat the same time cast an aspersion on the conduct or character of the\r\nGovernment servant, then it will not be proper to hold that the order of\r\ncompulsory retirement is in reality an order of punishment. Whether the\r\nstatement in the order is stigmatic or not will have to be judged by adopting\r\nthe test of how a reasonable person would\u00a0 read or understand it.\r\nAllahabad Bank Officers Association v.
