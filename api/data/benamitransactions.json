Yallappa Lalu Chaugule, AIR 1994 Bom 358.(ii) The defense raised by the contesting\r\nrespondents that the transaction of the sale under the sale deed dated 9th\r\nOctober, 1957 executed in favor of the appellants was a benami transaction is\r\nprohibited in view of section 4(2) of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition)\r\nAct, 1988; Duvuru Mohand Reddy v. Alluru Nagi Reddy, AIR 1994 SC 1647.(iii) The defense taken by the defendant that\r\nthe plot in fact was purchased by him in the name of his brother i.e. the plot\r\nwas purchased benami, cannot be allowed by virtue of section4(2) of the Benami\r\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988; Om Prakash Rawal v. Justice Amrit Lal\r\nBahri, AIR 1994 HP 27.(iv) Under section 88 of Indian Trusts Act, an\r\nagent or other person bound is in a fiduciary character to protect the interest\r\nof the principal and the former would hold the property for the benefit of the\r\nprincipal or the person in whose behalf he acted as an agent. Held that a real\r\npurchaser is the respondent, the petitioner as an agent and power of attorney\r\nhad purchased the property but ostensibly had his name entered in the sale\r\ncertificate fraudulently and without consent of the principal and the question\r\nof benami does not arise though section 4 prohibits such a plea; P. V. Sankara\r\nKarup v. Leelavathy Nambiar, AIR 1994 SC 2694.(v) A coparcenery is purely a creature of law\r\nand it cannot be created by act of parties whereas a composite family is the\r\nresult of an agreement express or implied. There are incidents to the\r\nconstitution of a composite family, but all incidents are consequences of the\r\nagreement between the parties. Held that exception is section4(3) could not be\r\nattracted in the present case of an alleged composite family; B. Rajagopal Reddy\r\nv. Padmini Chandrasekharan, AIR 1990 Mad 353.(vi) On coming into force of the Benami\r\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, defense raised for the proof of the fact that\r\nthe property held by a person is in the capacity of a benamidar is expressly\r\nprohibited. Neither the court is permitted in law to consider such defense nor\r\nto record its findings. Held that the Income-tax Deptt. would be prohibited\r\nfrom raising a defense that the suit property held by the wife is benami and\r\nthe real owner is her husband; Smt. Khateeja Bai v. Union of India, AIR 1994\r\nNOC 136 MP.(vii) The plaintiff cannot lay any claim in\r\nview of section 4 to the house on the ground that they stand in the name of\r\nstep mother benami for her deceased father, Baghyavathi v. Lakahmikathammal,\r\nAIR 1993 Mad 346.(viii) The burden of showing that a transfer\r\nis a benami transaction lies on the person who asserts that is such a\r\ntransaction. The governing principal for determining the question whether a\r\ntransaction is benami or not is to be proved by showing that the purchase money\r\ncame from a person other than the person in whose favor the property is\r\ntransferred . The intention of the person who contributed towards the money has\r\nto be inferred from the circumstances and the relationship of the parties and\r\nthe motive governing their action in bringing about the transaction and their\r\nsubsequent conduct; Mahinder Singh v. Pardaman Singh, AIR 1992 Del 357.(ix) In view of section 4, there is a total\r\nprohibition against any suit based on benami transaction and the\r\nplaintiff-respondent is not entitled to get any decree in such suit or in\r\nappeal, an appeal being a constitution of suit and in the present case the\r\nappeal was pending before this court. In s suit for recovery of benami property\r\nif any appeal is pending on the date of coming into force of section 4 the\r\nappellant court can take into account the subsequent legislative changes; Om\r\nPrakash v. Jai Prakah, AIR 1992 SC 885.(x) Section 4 of the Benami Transaction\r\n(Prohibition ) Act, must be taken to relate of section 2 of the Benami\r\nTransactions (Prohibition of the Right to Recover Property) Ordinance, 1988. It\r\nis clear that in spite of the recommendation of the Law Commission of India to\r\nbar institution of suits only, the Ordinance making authority has thought if it\r\nto bar other proceedings also and has also provided in express words barring of\r\nall claims and actions to enforce the right of a person alleging to be the real\r\nowner against the benemidar. The Legislature by using the expression \u2018shall\r\nlie\u2019 made departure from the usual expression \u2019shall be institute\u2019 clearly\r\ndemonstrate its resolve to regulate all such suits, claims or actions also\r\nwhich would be lying in the court on the date of its commencement; Urmila Bala\r\nDasi v. Probodh Chandra Ghosh, AIR Cal 283.(xi) The expression any property held benami\r\nis not limited to any particular time, date or duration i.e. the Benami\r\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 is retrospective in operation. Once the\r\nproperty is found to have been held benami no suit, claim or action to enforce\r\nany right in respect thereof shall lie. Sub-section (2) of section 4 similarly\r\nnullifies the defenses based on any right in respect of any property held\r\nbenami. Section 4 in its sweep envisages past benami transaction also within\r\nits retroactivity. In this sence the Act is both a penal and a disqualifying\r\nstatute. Held that as the appeal was pending in Supreme Court on commencement\r\nof the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, the matter becomes\r\nsub-judice and thereafter the \u2018Supreme Court\u2019 had seisin of the whole case and\r\nthe decree passed by the lower courts annihilated and the suit dismissed;\r\nMithilesh Kumari v. Prem Behari Khare, AIR 1989 SC 1247.(xii) The benamidar before the enactment of\r\nBenami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 could not have any right, title and\r\ninterest in the property which the benamidar could convey. By the principle of\r\nfictional relation back as propounded by the Supreme Court in Mithlesh Kumari,\r\nthe benamidar should be deemed to have title to the property on the date he\r\nexecuted the deed or release. Held that Surendra Kumar was the benamidar and in\r\npoint of act on the date of execution of the deed of release he had no right or\r\ninterest in the property; Ratanlal Bansilal v. Kishorilal Goenka, AIR 1993 Cal\r\n144.(xiii) It has been held that the suit is not\r\nhit by sections 2 and 4 of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 as\r\nthe plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant No 1 i.e. one of the partners\r\nwas or is a benamidar or that the money was paid by the plaintiff or that the\r\nproperty was purchased in the name of the defendant No.1 as benamidar apart\r\nfrom that the under section 14 and 15 of the Partnership Act, a partnership can\r\nacquire asserts in the name of partners and these sections have not been\r\ndeleted by the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988; Md. Hasan Hashmi v.\r\nSmt. Kaberi Roy, AIR 1993 Cal 70.(xiv) Section 4 takes into its ambit the right\r\nof a real owner vis-\u00e0-vis ostensible owner. The prohibition under section 4(1) and\r\n(2) does not prohibit the right of a third party to get a declaration. The\r\nthird party has the right to raise the contention that someone was the real\r\ntransferee and the sale deed was only executed in the name of the transferee\r\nwho was a benamidar, Gopal Bariha v. Satyanarayan Das, AIR 1991 Ori 131.(xv) Section 2 of the Benami Transactions\r\n(Prohibition of the Right to Recover Property) Ordinance, 1988 relates to\r\nsection 4 of the Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 1988 and according to\r\nsection 2 of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition of the Right to Recover\r\nProperty) Ordinance, 1988, action means a civil proceeding commenced by\r\n\"writ\" or in such other manner, as may be prescribed by rules of\r\ncourt but does not include a criminal proceeding, therefore the term\r\n\"action\" is wide enough to take in an appeal or a second appeal;\r\nVelayudhan Ramkrishan v. Rajeev, AIR 1989 Ker 12.(xvi) In the context and setting of section 4\r\nthe word \u2018held \u2018 has to be understood as \"possessed or occupied\". If\r\nthe possession or occupation is not benami, section 4 can have no application\r\nand as a sham transaction or bipartite transaction is not a benami. Section 4\r\ndoes not apply to such a transaction; Ouseph Chacko v. Raman Nair, AIR 1989 Ker\r\n317.(xvii) Section 4 and 7 of the Benami\r\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 relate to sections 2 and 4 of the Benami\r\nTransactions(Prohibition of the Right to Recover Property) Ordinance, 1988.\r\nBoth section 7 of the Benami Act and section 4 of the Benami Ordinance repeal\r\nsection 82 of the Trusts Act keeping section 81 of the Trusts Act intact.\r\nKeeping in view section 81 of Trusts Act nominal transactions are not intended\r\nto be covered and are not hit by section 4;B.
