This presumption\r\nmay be rebutted by the employer and also by the State Government if it so\r\nchooses but unless and until satisfactory material is produced for rebutting\r\nthis presumption, the Court must proceed on the basis that the laborer is a\r\nbonded laborer entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Act.
