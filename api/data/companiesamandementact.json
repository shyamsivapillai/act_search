issue of debentures;(e)\r\nto take steps to call a meeting of holders of debentures as and when such\r\nmeeting is required to be held.(4)\r\nWhere at any time the debenture trustee comes to a conclusion that the assets\r\nof the company are insufficient or are likely to become insufficient to\r\ndischarge the principal amount as and when it becomes due, the debenture\r\ntrustee may file a petition before the Company Law Board and the Company Law\r\nBoard may, after hearing the company and any other person interested in the\r\nmatter, by an order, impose such restrictions on the

the\r\ndebentures in accordance with the terms and conditions of their issue.(4)\r\nWhere a company fails to redeem the debentures on the date of maturity, the\r\nCompany Law Board may, on the application of any or all the holders of\r\ndebentures shall, after hearing the parties concerned, direct, by order, the\r\ncompany to redeem the debentures forthwith by the payment of principal and\r\ninterest due thereon.(5)\r\nIf default is made in complying with the order of the Company Law Board under\r\nsub-section (4), every officer of the company who is in default, shall
