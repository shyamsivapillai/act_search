Subjective satisfaction - Validity ofIt is well settled that the subjective satisfaction requisite on\r\nthe part of the detaining authority, the formation of which is a condition\r\nprecedent to the passing of the detention order will get initiated if material\r\nor vital facts which would have a bearing on the issue and would influence the\r\nmind of the detaining authority one way or the other are ignored or not\r\nconsidered by the detaining authority before issuing the detention order. [ Varinder Singh Batra  v.Union of India & Ors., (1993) 3 Crimes 637 (Delhi)].\r\nR / t: Ashadevi v.Shivraj \r\n& Anr ., AIR 1979 Sc 447. R/t. Ayya \r\nalias Ayub v.State of U.P\r\n& Anr ., (1989) 1 Crimes 8 (S.C.).If a piece of evidence which might reasonably have affected the\r\ndecision whether or not to pass an order of detention is excluded from\r\nconsideration, there would be a failure of application of mind, which in turn,\r\nvitiates the detention. [ abid ].There would be vitiation of the detention order on grounds of\r\nnon-application of mind if a piece of evidence which was relevant though not\r\nbinding, had not been considered at all. [ibid].If an important document on which reliance has been placed by\r\nthe detaining authority and it has not been supplied to the detenu \r\nit is sufficient to vitiate the order of detention. [Mohammed  Salim / Khatri v.Union \r\nof India & Anr ., (1993) 3 Crimes 867 (Delhi)].It is the duty of the sponsoring authority to collect all the\r\nrelevant material and place it before the detaining authority. The requisite\r\nsubjective satisfaction the formation of which is a condition precedent to\r\npassing of a detention order will get vitiated if material or vital facts which\r\nwould have bearing on the issue and weighted the satisfaction of the detaining\r\nauthority one way or the other and influenced his mind are either withheld or\r\nsuppressed by the sponsoring authority or ignored and not considered by the\r\ndetaining authority before issuing the detention order.

(1993) 49 Delhi Law Times 174.Every failure to furnish copy of a document to which reference\r\nis made in the grounds of detention under section 3(1) of COFEPOSA is not an\r\ninfringement of article 22(5) of the Constitution fatal to the order of\r\ndetention. It is only failure of furnish copies of such documents as were relied\r\nupon by the detaining authority, making it difficult for the  detenu to make an effective representation that amounts to\r\na violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by article 22(5).[ abid ] R/t Mst . L.M.S.  Ummu Saleema v.B.B .\r\n Gujaral & Anr ., AIR\r\n1981 SC 1191.When the non-supply of copies of relevant documents has\r\nprevented the detenu from making an effect and\r\npurposeful representation, it results in violation of article 22(5) of the\r\nConstitution of India read with section 3(3) of the COFEPOSA. [ibid].Documents cannot be said irrelevant when they have been\r\nmentioned in the detention order and reliance has been placed upon them.\r\n[ibid].B. Grounds - Communication ofSince the order is based on grounds to be served on the  detenu , the order of detention could be passed only if the\r\ngrounds are in existence and are prepared contemporaneously, otherwise the\r\norder of detention becomes purely illusory. [ Pakhar \r\nSingh v.Union of India & Anr .,\r\n(1993) 3 Crimes 765 (P & H) R/t. Krishna Murari  Aggarwal v.Union of India, AIR\r\n1975 SC 1877.It is the duty of the detaining authority to satisfy the court\r\nabout the existence of the material and that he has not acted in a mechanical\r\nor cavalier manner while exercising the power. The detaining authority owes a duty\r\nto the detenu as wall as to the Court. An obligation\r\nof the detaining authority is to satisfy the Court that he has acted in\r\naccordance with law. [ abid ] R/t. Mohiuddin \r\n Tayab Sony v.State of  Maharashtra & Anr ., 1980  Crl . LJ. 1040 ( Bom .) D.B.It is well settled that judicial scrutiny cannot be shut our\r\nmerely on the ipsedixit of the detaining authority. [ abid ]. Ibid.The grounds of detention must be communicated in the language\r\nunderstood by the detenu . [In re: Smt .\r\n B.Ramprannamma , 1993 FAJ 485 (Cal Circuit Bench at\r\nPort Blair) D.B.]Article 22(5) of the Constitution requires that the grounds of\r\ndetention must be communicated to the detenu .\r\n\"Communicate\" is a strong word. It requires that sufficient knowledge\r\nof the basic-facts constituting the grounds should be imparted effectively and\r\nfully to the detenu in writing in a language which he\r\nunderstands, so as to enable him to make a purposeful and effective\r\nrepresentation. If the grounds are only verbally explained to the  detenu and nothing in writing is left with him in a\r\nlanguage which he understands, then that purpose is not served, and the\r\nconstitutional mandate in article 22(5) is infringed. This follows from the\r\ndecisions in Harikisan v. State of  Maharashtra , AIR 1962 SC 911, and Hadibandhu \r\n Das v.District Magistrate,  Cuttack and Ors., AIR 1969 SC 43.In the case of Smt .  Raziya Umar Bakshi \r\n v.Union of India and Ors., AIR 1980 SC 1751, it was\r\nheld by the Supreme Court that the service of the ground of detention on the  detenue is a very precious constitutional right and where\r\nthe grounds are couched in a language which is not known to the  detenu , unless the contents of the grounds are fully\r\nexplained and translated to the detenu , it will\r\ntantamount to not serving the grounds of detention to the detenue \r\nand would thus vitiate the detention ex-facie. In case where the detaining\r\nauthority is satisfied that the grounds are couched in a language which is not\r\nknown to the detenue , it must see to it that the\r\ngrounds are explained to the detenu , a translated\r\nscript is given to him and the grounds bear some sort of a certificate to show\r\nthat the grounds have been explained to the detenue \r\nin the language which he understands. A bare statement at the stage when Habeas\r\nCorpus petition is filed in the Court by the detaining authority that these\r\nformalities were observed would be of no consequence particularly when it is\r\nnot supported by any document or by any affidavit of the person who had done\r\nthe job of explaining or translation.In the case of Mr. Kubic  Dariusz v. Union of India and other, AIR 1990 SC 605, the\r\nSupreme Court observed that 'it is settled law that the communication of the\r\ngrounds which is required by the earlier part of clause (5) of article 22 is\r\nfor the purpose of enabling the detenu to make a\r\nrepresentation, the right to which is guaranteed by the latter part of the\r\nclause'. A communication in this context, must, therefore, mean imparting to\r\nthe detenu sufficient and effective knowledge of the\r\nfacts and circumstances on which the order of detention is passed, that is, of\r\nthe prejudicial acts which the authorities attribute to him. Such a\r\ncommunication would be there when it is made in a language understood by the  detenu .C. Execution - Prior toIt is well settled that the High Courts have the powers to\r\nentertain and examine the grievances against the detention order prior to its\r\nexecution. [ Pakhar Singh v. Union of India &  Anr ., (1993) 3 Crimes 765 (P & H). R/t. Addl. Secretary\r\nto the Government of India & Ors. V.Smt .  Alka Subhash Gadia \r\n& Anr ., 1992 SCC ( Crl .)\r\n301.The grounds on which the courts have interfered with them at the\r\npre execution stage are necessarily very limited in scope and number, viz.,\r\nwhere the courts are prima facie satisfied( i ) that the\r\nimpugned order is not passed under the Act under which it is purported to have\r\nbeen passed,(ii) that it is sought to be executed against\r\na wrong person,(iii) that it is passed for a wrong purpose,(iv) that it is passed on vague, extraneous\r\nand irrelevant grounds, or(v) that the authority which passed it has no\r\nauthority to do so.It is well settled in our Constitution frame word that the power\r\nof directing preventive detention given to the appropriate authorities must be\r\nexercised in exceptional cases as contemplated by the various provisions of the\r\ndifferent statutes dealing with preventive detention and should be used with\r\ngreat deal of circumspection. There must be awareness of the facts\r\nnecessitating preventive custody of a person for social defense. If a man is in\r\ncustody and there is no imminent possibility of his being released, the power\r\nof preventive detention should not be exercised. [ Ibrahim \r\n Umarbhaya v. State of Gujarat & Ors., (1993) 3\r\nCrimes 730 ( Guj .) D.B.] R/t. Rameshwar \r\nShaw v. District Magistrate, AIR 1964 SC 334.D. Pre-execution stage - Challenge atDetention order under the Act cannot be challenged at\r\npre-execution stage merely on the ground that there was delay in its execution.\r\n[ Inderjit Singh Chani v.\r\nUnion of India & Anr ., (1994) 1 Crimes 539\r\n(Delhi)].E. Delay - Effect ofLong and undue delay in passing the detention order snaps the\r\nnexus between the activity alleged and the activity sought to be curbed and\r\nshows that the detention order was passed mechanically without application of\r\nmind.When the detention order has been passed after a long delay and\r\nthe service was also effected after delay the detention order is liable to be\r\nquashed. [ Daljit Singh Sandhu \r\nv. Union of India & Ors., (1993) 3 Crimes 629 (Delhi)].No doubt it is true that if the detaining authority shows that\r\nthere is a reasonable nexus between the prejudicial activity and the purpose of\r\ndetention, the delay in passing the detention order has to be overlooked.\r\n[ibid].The delay in passing the detention order, if not adequately\r\nexplained, vitiates the same. [ibid].Indeed more delay in passing a detention order is not\r\nconclusive. The authorities concerned must have due regard to the object with\r\nwhich the order is passed. Inordinate delay in passing of a detention order\r\nwill raise genuine doubt about the satisfaction of the Detaining Authority.The test as to whether the detention order should be quashed on\r\nthe ground of delay is not a rigid or mechanical test by merely counting the\r\nnumber of days or months; the court should examine whether the Detaining\r\nAuthority has satisfactorily explained the delay.

State of Kerala , (1989) 2 All India Criminal\r\nLaw Reporter 294 (S.C.)].The detenu had been evading execution\r\nof the detention order hardly gives credit to the authorities  incharge of enforcing the orders of detention. In case\r\nwhere the authorities are guilty of inaction after passing of the order, a\r\nreasonable conclusion has to be drawn that the detention order has lost nexus\r\nwith the prejudicial activities.

Undue and unexplained delay in disposing of the representation\r\nvitiates the detention order.[ Hussain  Erumban vs. Union of India, (1993) 3 crimes 627 (Delhi)].It is settled law that the representation made by the  detenu for seeking revocation of te \r\ndetention order must be dealt with promptly and in right earnest by the\r\nauthorities concerned and they are not supposed to deal with the representation\r\nin a casual manner and allow the same to remain unattended for any period of\r\ntime. If there occurs any undue delay in dealing with the representation it is\r\nincumbent upon the authorities to explain such delay. [ibid].Detaining Authority-Duty ofIn smt . Gracy \r\nvs. State of Kerala , (1991 ) 41 DLT1, the Supreme\r\nCourt observed that the detaining authority is obliged to consider the\r\nrepresentation even if the same was simply addressed to the Advisory Board and\r\nnot to him.\"It being settled that the aforesaid deal obligation of\r\nconsideration of the detenu\u2019s representation by the\r\nAdvisory Board and independently by the detaining authority flows from article\r\n22 (5) when only one representation is made and addressed to the detaining\r\nauthority there is no reason to hold that the detaining authority is relieved\r\nof this obligation merely because the representation is addressed to the\r\nAdvisory Board instead of the detaining authority and submitted to the Advisory\r\nBoard during pendency of the reference before it. It\r\nis difficult to spell out such an inference from the contents of article 22 (5)\r\nin support of the contention of the learned Solicitor General. The contents of\r\narticle 22(5) as well as the nature of duty imposed thereby on the detaining\r\nauthority support the view that so long as there is a representation made by\r\nthe detenu against the order of detention, the\r\naforesaid dual obligation under article 22 (5) arises irrespective of the fact\r\nwhether the representation is addressed to the detaining authority or to the\r\nAdvisory Board or to both. The mode of address is only a matter of form which\r\ncannot whittle down the requirement of the constitutional mandate in article 22\r\n(5) enacted as one of the safeguard provided to the detenu \r\nin case of preventive detention.\"It is clear that once the detenu makes\r\na representation, it has to be considered by the detaining authority\r\nindependent of its consideration by the Advisory Board.[ Yashvir \r\nSingh vs. Administrator, Delhi & Ors., (1993) 3 Crimes 441 (Delhi)].", "12": "Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 197412.
