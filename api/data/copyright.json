The originality which is required relates to the\r\nexpression of the thought; but the Act does not require that the expression\r\nmust be in an original or novel form, but that the work must not be copied from\r\nanother work - that it should originate from the author.In order to obtain copyright production for\r\nliterary, domestic, musical and artistic works, the subject dealt with need not\r\nbe original , nor the ideas expressed be something novel. What is required is\r\nthe expenditure of original skill or labor in execution and not originality of\r\nthought.No original thought or original research is\r\nrequired in order that a literary work may be deemed to be original. The\r\nstandard of originality which is required is a low one.In modern complex society provisions have to\r\nbe made for protecting every man's copyright, whether high or small, whether\r\ninvolving a high degree of originality as in a new poem or picture, or only\r\noriginality at the vanishing point as in a law report.Copyright in abridgement \u2013Strictly speaking, an abridgement of an\r\nauthor's work means a statement designed to be complete and accurate of the\r\nthoughts, opinions, and ideas by him expressed therein, but set forth much more\r\nconcisely in the compressed language of the abridger.Selections \u2013Where the plaintiff's selection of poems was\r\nborrowed by the defendants, it was held that defendants book had infringed the\r\ncopyright of the plaintiff. The true principle in all these cases is, that the\r\ndefendant is not at liberty to use or avail himself of the labor which the\r\nplaintiff has been at for the purpose of producing his work, that is, in fact,\r\nmerely to take away the result of another man's labor, or, in other words, his\r\nproperty.Reports of judgments \u2013It is generally true that in the reports of\r\njudgments the reporter has no copyright, but is cannot be said that in the\r\nselection of cases and in the arrangement of the reporting the reporter has not\r\nthe protection of law. The defendant is entitled to report such judgments as he\r\nobtains by expenditure of his time, labor and money but where he fails to exert\r\nhis own energies, he cannot be allowed to avail himself of other people's\r\nindustry.\"Whilst all are entitled to resort to\r\ncommon sources of information none are entitled to save themselves trouble and\r\nexpense by availing themselves for their own profit of other men's works,\r\nsubject to copyright and entitled to protection.\"Question papers \u2013In a Patna case it has been held that question\r\npapers set at examination are original literary works though the paper-setter\r\nmay have copied questions from textbooks.Persons who set the question papers are\r\nauthors of the work and they are the first owners of the copyright therein.", "14": "Copyright Act, 1957 14.

There can be no\r\ncopyright in an idea, subject-matter, themes, plots or historical or legendary\r\nfacts and violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form,\r\nmanner and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the\r\ncopyrighted work.2. Where the same idea\r\nis being developed in a different manner, it is manifest that the source being\r\ncommon, similarities are bound to occur. In such a case the courts should\r\ndetermine whether or not the similarities are on fundamental or substantial\r\naspects of the mode of expression adopted in the copyrighted work. If the\r\ndefendant's work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted, work\r\nwith some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the\r\ncopy-right. In other words, in order to be actionable the copy must be a\r\nsubstantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the\r\ndefendant is guilty of an act of piracy.3. One of the surest\r\nand the safest test to determine whether or not there has been a violation of\r\ncopyright is to see if the reader, spectator or the viewer after having read or\r\nseen both the works is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable\r\nimpression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original.4. Where the theme is\r\nthe same but is presented and treated differently so that the subsequent work\r\nbecomes a completely new work, no question of violation of copyright arises.5. Where however apart\r\nfrom the similarities appearing in the two works there are also material and\r\nbroad dissimilarities which negative the intention to copy the original and the\r\ncoincidences appearing in the two works are clearly incidental no infringement\r\nof the copyright comes into existence.6. As a violation of\r\ncopyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved by clear and cogent\r\nevidence after applying the various tests laid down by the case law discussed\r\nabove.7. Where, however, the\r\nquestion is of the violation of the copyright of stage play by a film producer\r\nor a Director the task of the plaintiff becomes more difficult to prove piracy.\r\nIt is manifest that unlike a stage play a film has a much broader perspective,\r\nwider field and a bigger background where the defendants can by introducing a\r\nvariety of incidents give a colour and complexion different from the manner in\r\nwhich the copyrighted work has expressed the idea. Even so, if the viewer after\r\nseeing the film gets a totality of impression that the film is by and large a\r\ncopy of the original play, violation of the copyright may be said to be proved.\r\nR G.
