Duty of employer to pay equal remuneration\r\nto men and women workers for same work or work of a similar nature.(1) No employer shall pay to any worker,\r\nemployed by him in an establishment or employment, remuneration, whether\r\npayable in cash or in kind, at rates less favorable than those at which\r\nremuneration is paid by him to the workers of the opposite sex in such\r\nestablishment or employment for performing the same work or work of a similar\r\nnature.(2) No employer shall, for the purpose of\r\ncomplying with the provisions of sub-section (1), reduce the rate of\r\nremuneration of any worker.(3) Where, in an establishment on employment,\r\nthe rates of remuneration payable before the commencement of this Act for men\r\nand women workers for the same work or work of a similar nature are different\r\nonly on the ground of sex, then the higher (in cases where there are only two\r\nrates), or, as the case may be, the highest (in cases where there are more than\r\ntwo rates) of such rates shall be the rate at which remuneration shall be payable,\r\non and from such commencement, to such men and women workers.PROVIDED  that nothing in this sub-section shall\r\nbe deemed to entitle a worker to the revision of the rate of remuneration\r\npayable to him or her with reference to the service rendered by him or her\r\nbefore the commencement of this Act.Comment:  It is lastly urged on behalf of the\r\npetitioner that the enforcement of the Act will be highly prejudicial to the\r\nmanagement, since its financial position is not satisfactory and the management\r\nis not able to pay equal remuneration to both male Stenographers and female\r\nStenographers. The Act does not permit the management to pay to a section of\r\nits employees doing the same work or a work of similar nature lesser pay\r\ncontrary to section 4(1) of the Act only because it is not able to pay equal\r\nremuneration to all. The applicability of the Act does not depend upon the\r\nfinancial ability of the management to pay equal remuneration as provided by\r\nit. AIR 1987 SUPREME COURT 1281, Mackinnon Mackenzie and Co.
