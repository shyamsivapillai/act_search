The only fault of the appellant is to have\r\npursued his studies beyond 10th class of his school. If he had discontinued his\r\ncareer as a student even earlier, say after passing 7th or 8th class, he would\r\nhave been running the shop today. This clearly amounts to gross arbitrariness\r\nand, therefore, illegal discrimination. Pursuing this line the State will have\r\nto be going in search of a more inefficient person and we do not know where\r\nthis process would end. If we assume that since a better qualified person has\r\ngot a better chance to succeed in life, an intelligent applicant who can run\r\nthe shop efficiently should be rejected and a dim witted fellow should be\r\nselected. This is an absurd situation. Y. Srinivasa Rao , Appellant v. J. Veeraiah AIR 1993 SUPREME COURT 929", "4": "Essential Commodities Act, 1955 4.
