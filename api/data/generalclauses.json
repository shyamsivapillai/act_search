As \"the\r\nessential idea of a legal system is that current law should govern current\r\nactivities\". We hold that rate of compensation shall have to be determined\r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Act which was in force at the time\r\ncompensation was payable i.e. unamended sub-section\r\n(4) of Section 25 of the Act would apply. Moreover, the amending Act affects\r\nthe substantive right of the appellant, therefore, it would have prospective\r\noperation. There is also no express or implied provision in the amending Act to\r\nindicate that the Act will have retrospective effect. We, therefore, hold that\r\nthe amending Act would apply prospectively.
