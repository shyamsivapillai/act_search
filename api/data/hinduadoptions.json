Other conditions for a valid adoption In every adoption, the following conditions must be complied\r\nwith:(i) if the adoption is of a son, the adoptive father or mother\r\nby whom the adoption is made must not have a Hindu son, son's son or son's son\r\n(whether by legitimate blood relationship or by adoption) living at the time of\r\nadoption;(ii) if the adoption is of a daughter, the adoptive father or\r\nmother by whom the adoption is made must not have a Hindu daughter or son's\r\ndaughter (whether by legitimate blood relationship or by adoption) living at\r\nthe time of adoption;(iii) if the adoption is by a male and the person to be adopted\r\nis a female, the adoptive father is at least twenty-one years older than the\r\nperson to be adopted;(iv) if the adoption is by a female and the person to be adopted\r\nis a male, the adoptive mother is at least twenty-one years older than the\r\nperson to be adopted;(v) the same child may not be adopted simultaneously by two or\r\nmore persons;(vi) the child to be adopted must be actually given and taken in\r\nadoption by the parents or guardian concerned or under their authority with\r\nintent to transfer the child from the family of its birth 2[or in the case of\r\nan abandoned child or child whose parentage is not known, from the place or\r\nfamily where it has been brought up] to the family of its adoption:PROVIDED  that the performance of datta homam shall not\r\nbe essential to the validity of adoption.", "12": " Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 12. Effects of adoption An adopted child shall be deemed to be the child of his or her\r\nadoptive father or mother for all purposes with effect from the date of the\r\nadoption and from such date all the ties of the child in the family of his or\r\nher birth shall be deemed to be severed and replaced by those created by the\r\nadoption in the adoptive family:PROVIDED  that- (a) the child cannot marry any person whom he or she could not\r\nhave married if he or she had continued in the family of his or her birth;(b) any property which vested in the adopted child before the\r\nadoption shall continue to vest in such person subject to the obligations, if\r\nany, attaching to the ownership of such property including the obligation to\r\nmaintain relatives in the family of his or her birth;(c) the adopted child shall not divest any person of any estate\r\nwhich vested in him or her before the adoption.Comment:  It is clear on a reading of the main part of\r\nSection 12 and sub-section(vi) of Section 11 that the effect of adoption under the Act is\r\nthat it brings about severance of all ties of the child given in adoption in\r\nthe family of his or her birth. The child altogether ceases to have any ties\r\nwith the family of his birth. Correspondingly, these very ties are\r\nautomatically replaced by those created by the adoption in the adoptive family.\r\nThe legal effect of giving the child in adoption must therefore be to transfer\r\nthe child from the family of its birth to the family of its adoption.
