A accepts the loan on these terms. This is\r\na transaction in the ordinary course of business, and the contract is not\r\ninduced by undue influence.]", "17": " Indian Contract Act, 1872 17. \"Fraud defined\"Fraud\" means and includes any of the following acts\r\ncommitted by a party to a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agents\n, with intent to deceive another party thereto or his agent, or to induce\r\nhim to enter into the contract:(1) the suggestion as a fact, of that which is not true, by one\r\nwho does not believe it to be true;(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or\r\nbelief of the fact;(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it;(4) any other act fitted to deceive;(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be\r\nfraudulent. Explanation:   Mere silence as to facts likely to\r\naffect the willingness of a person to enter into a contract is not fraud,\r\nunless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them,\r\nit is the duty of the person keeping silence to speak, or unless his silence\r\nis, in itself, equivalent to speech. Illustrations (a) A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be\r\nunsound. A says nothing to B about the horse's unsoundness. This is not fraud\r\nin A.(b) B is A\u2019s daughter and has just come of age. Here the\r\nrelation between the parties would make it A's duty to tell B if the horse is\r\nunsound.(c) B says to A- \"If you do not deny it, I shall assume\r\nthat the horse is sound\". A says nothing. Here, A's silence is equivalent\r\nto speech.(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract, A has private\r\ninformation of a change in prices which would affect B's willingness to proceed\r\nwith the contract.

Illustrations (a) A, intending to deceive B, falsely represents that five\r\nhundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A's factory, and thereby induces\r\nB to buy the factory. The contract is voidable at the option of B.(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe\r\nthat five hundred mounds of indigo are made annually at A's factory. B examines\r\nthe accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo\r\nhave been made. After this B buys the factory. The contract is not voidable on\r\naccount of A's misrepresentation.(c) A fraudulently informs B that A's estate is free from\r\nencumbrance. B thereupon buys the estate. The estate is subject to a mortgage.\r\nB may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the\r\nmortgage-debt redeemed.(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A,\r\nadopts means to conceal, and does conceal the existence of the ore from A.\r\nThough A's ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an undervalue. The\r\ncontract is voidable at the option of A.(e) A is entitled to succeed to an estate at the death of B, B\r\ndies; C having received intelligence of B's death, prevents the intelligence\r\nreaching A, and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate.

Illustrations (a) A contracts to sell and deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B,\r\nat a certain price to be paid on delivery. A breaks his promise. B is entitled\r\nto receive from A, by way of compensation, the sum, if any, by which the\r\ncontract price falls short of the price for which B might have obtained 50\r\nmaunds of saltpetre of like quality at the time when the saltpetre ought to\r\nhave been delivered.(b) A hires B's ship to go to Bombay, and there takes on board,\r\non the first of January, a cargo, which A is to provide, and to bring it to\r\nCalcutta, the freight to be paid when earned. B's ship does not go to Bombay,\r\nbut A has opportunities for procuring suitable conveyance for the cargo upon\r\nterms as advantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship. A avails\r\nhimself of those opportunities, but is put to trouble and expense in doing so.\r\nA is entitled to receive compensation from B in respect of such trouble and\r\nexpense.(c) A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 maunds of\r\nrice, no time being fixed for delivery. A afterwards informs B that he will not\r\naccept the rice if tendered to him. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of\r\ncompensation, the amount, if any, by which the contract price exceeds that\r\nwhich B can obtain for the rice at the time when A informs B that he will not\r\naccept it.(d) A contracts to buy B's ship for 60,000 rupees, but breaks\r\nthe promise. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the excess, if any, of\r\nthe contract price over the price which B can obtain for the ship at the time\r\nof breach of promise.(e) A, the owner of a boat, contracts with B to take a cargo of\r\njute to Mirzapur, for sale at that place, starting on a specified day. The\r\nboat, owing to some unavoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed,\r\nwhereby the arrival of the cargo at Mirzapur is delayed beyond the time when it\r\nwould have arrived if the boat had sailed according to the contract. After that\r\ndate, and before the arrival of the cargo, the price of jute falls. The measure\r\nof the compensation payable to B by A is the difference between the price which\r\nB could have obtained for the cargo at Mirzapur at the time when it would have\r\narrived if forwarded in due course, and its market price at the time when it\r\nactually arrived.(f) A contracts to repair B's house in a certain manner, and\r\nreceives payment in advance. A repairs the house, but not according to\r\ncontract. B is entitled to recover from A the cost of making the repairs\r\nconforming to the contract.(g) A contracts to let his ship to B for a year, from first of\r\nJanuary, for a certain price. Freights rise, and, on the first of January, the\r\nhire obtainable for the ship is higher than the contract price. A breaks his\r\npromise. He must pay to B, by way of compensation, a sum equal to the\r\ndifference between the contract price and the price for which B could hire a\r\nsimilar ship for a year on and from the first of January.(h) A contracts to supply B with a certain quantity of iron at a\r\nfixed price, being a higher price than that for which A could procure and\r\ndeliver the iron. B wrongfully refuses to receive the iron. B must pay to A, by\r\nway of compensation, the difference between the contract price of the iron and\r\nthe sum for which A could have obtained and delivered it.(i) A delivers to B, a common carrier, a machine, to be\r\nconveyed, without delay, to A's mill, informing B that his mill is stopped for\r\nwant of the machine. B unreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A,\r\nin consequence, loses a profitable contract with the Government. A is entitled\r\nto receive from B, by way of compensation, the average amount of profit which\r\nwould have been made by the working of the mill during the time that delivery\r\nof it was delayed, but not the loss sustained through the loss of the\r\nGovernment contract.(j) A, having contracted with B to supply B with 1,000 tons of\r\niron at 100 rupees a ton, to be delivered at a stated time, contracts with C\r\nfor the purchase of 1,000 tones of iron at 80 rupees a ton, telling C that he\r\ndoes so for the purpose of performing his contract with B. C fails to perform\r\nhis contract with A, who cannot procure other iron, and B, in consequence,\r\nrescinds the contract. C must pay to A 20,000 rupees, being the profit which A\r\nwould have made by the performance of his contract with B.(k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day,\r\nfor a specified price, a certain piece of machinery. A does not deliver the\r\npiece of machinery, at the time specified, and, in consequence of this, B is\r\nobliged to procure another at a higher price than that which he was to have\r\npaid to A, and is prevented from performing a contract which B had made with a\r\nhired person at the time of his contract with A (but which had not been\r\ncommunicated to A), and is compelled to make compensation for breach of that\r\ncontract. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the difference between the\r\ncontract price of the price of machinery and the sum paid by B for another, but\r\nnot the sum paid by B to the third person by way of compensation.(l) A, a builder, contracts to erect and finish a house by the\r\nfirst of January, in order that B may give possession of it at that time to C,\r\nto whom B has contracted to let it. A is informed of the contract between B and\r\nC. A builds the house so badly that, before the first of January, it falls down\r\nand has to be rebuilt by B, who in consequence, loses the rent which he was to\r\nhave received from C, and is obliged to make compensation to C for the breach\r\nof his contract. A must make compensation to B for the cost of rebuilding of\r\nthe house, for the rent lost, and for the compensation made to C.(m) A sells certain merchandise to B, warranting it to be of a particular\r\nquality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it to C with a similar\r\nwarranty. The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes\r\nliable to pay C a sum of money by way of compensation. B is entitled to be\r\nreimbursed this sum by A.(n) A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A\r\ndoes not pay the money on that day. B, in consequence of not receiving the\r\nmoney on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined. A is not\r\nliable to make good to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay\r\ntogether with interest up to the day of payment.(o) A contracts to deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B on the\r\nfirst of January, at a certain price. B, afterwards, before the first of\r\nJanuary, contracts to sell the saltpetre to C at a price higher than the market\r\nprice of the first of January. A breaks his promise. In estimating the\r\ncompensation payable by A to B, the market price of the first of January, and\r\nnot the profit which would have arisen to B from the sale to C, is to be taken\r\ninto account.(p) A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales of cotton to B on\r\na fixed day. A knows nothing of B's mode of conducting his business. A breaks\r\nhis promise, and B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill. A is not\r\nresponsible to B for the loss caused to B by closing of the mill.(q) A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on the first of\r\nJanuary, certain cloth which B intends to manufacture into caps of a particular\r\nkind, for which there is no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not\r\ndelivered till after the appointed time, and too late to be used that year in\r\nmaking caps. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the\r\ndifference between the contract price of the cloth and its market price at the\r\ntime of delivery, but not the profits which he expected to obtain by making\r\ncaps, nor the expenses which he has been put to in making preparation for the\r\nmanufacture.(r) A, a ship owner, contracts with B to convey him from\r\nCalcutta to Sydney in A's ship, sailing on the first of January, and B pays to\r\nA, by way of deposit, one-half of his passage-money. The ship does not sail on\r\nthe first of January, and B, after being in consequence, detained in Calcutta\r\nfor some time, and thereby put to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another\r\nvessel, and, in consequence, arriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum of money.\r\nA is liable to repay to B his deposit, with interest, and the expense to which\r\nhe is put by his detention in Calcutta, and the excess, if any, of the\r\npassage-money paid for the second ship over that agreed upon for the first, but\r\nnot the sum of money which B lost by arriving in Sydney too late.", "74": " Indian Contract Act, 1872 74.Compensation for breach of contract\r\nwhere penalty stipulated for 15  [When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the\r\ncontract as the amount be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract\r\ncontains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the\r\nbreach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been\r\ncaused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract\r\nreasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may\r\nbe, the penalty stipulated for.Explanation :  A stipulation for increased interest from the\r\ndate of default may be a stipulation by way of penalty.]Exception :  When any person enters into any bail bond,\r\nrecognizance or other instrument of the same nature or, under the provisions of\r\nany law, or under the orders of the Central Government or of any State Government,\r\ngives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in which the\r\npublic are interested, he shall be liable, upon breach of the condition of any\r\nsuch instrument, to pay the whole sum mentioned therein.Explanation :  A person who enters into a contract with the\r\ngovernment does not necessarily thereby undertake any public duty, or promise\r\nto do an act in which the public are interested.Illustrations(a) A contracts with B to pay B Rs. 1,000 if he fails to pay B\r\nRs. 500 on a given day.
