The\r\nplaintiff proves that the right was peaceable and openly enjoyed by him,\r\nclaiming title thereto, as an easement, and as of right, without interruption,\r\nfrom lst January, 1862 to lst January, 1882. The plaintiff is entitled to\r\njudgment.(b) In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was\r\npeaceable and openly enjoyed by him for twenty years, the defendant proves that\r\nfor a year of that time the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the servant\r\nheritage as lessee thereof and enjoyed the right as such lessee. The suit shall\r\nbe dismissed, for the right of way has not been enjoyed \"as an\r\neasement\" for twenty years.(c) In a like suit the plaintiff shows that the right was\r\npeaceably and openly enjoyed by him for twenty years. The defendant proves that\r\nthe plaintiff on one occasion during the twenty years had admitted that the\r\nuser was not of right and asked his leave to enjoy the right. The suit shall be\r\ndismissed, for the right of way has not been enjoyed \"as of right\"\r\nfor twenty years.Comment: As far as the question of opening of new\r\nwindows is concerned, it is open to the defendants to use their property in any\r\nmanner permitted by law; and hence they cannot be restrained from opening new\r\nwindows, as no customary right of privacy appears to have been pleaded or\r\nproved. This position is not disputed by the plaintiffs. It is, however,\r\nequally clear that, if the defendants open any new windows, the plaintiffs are\r\nfully entitled to block the same by raising the height of their walls and the\r\ndefendants are not entitled to break or damage the said walls or any portion\r\nthereof so as to remove the obstruction to their new windows.
