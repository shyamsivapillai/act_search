Submission of draft standing orders(1) Within six months from the date on which this Act becomes\r\napplicable to an industrial establishment, the employer shall submit to the\r\nCertifying Officer five copies of the draft standing orders proposed by him for\r\nadoption in his industrial establishment.(2) Provision shall be made in such draft for every matter set\r\nout in the Schedule which may be applicable to the industrial establishment,\r\nand where model standing orders have been prescribed, shall be, so far as is\r\npracticable, in conformity with such model.(3) The draft standing orders submitted under this section shall\r\nbe accompanied by a statement giving prescribed particulars of the workmen\r\nemployed in the industrial establishment including the name of the trade union,\r\nif any, to which they belong.(4) Subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, a group of\r\nemployers in similar industrial establishments may submit a joint draft of\r\nstanding orders under this section.Comment: The Act does not say that on such\r\ncertification, the Standing Orders acquire statutory effect or become part of\r\nthe statute. It can certainly not be suggested that by virtue of certification,\r\nthey get metamorphosed into delegated/subordinate legislation. Though these\r\nStanding Orders are undoubtedly binding upon both the employer and the\r\nemployees and constitute the conditions of service of the employees, it appears\r\ndifficult to say, on principle, that they have statutory force.
