It is an enabling provision. It provides that all amounts due\r\nunder the Land Improvement Loans Act, shall, notwithstanding anything contained\r\ntherein, become due 'forthwith', upon the vesting of the zamindari \r\nrights. It then lays down that such dues may, without prejudice to any other\r\nmode of recovery provided therefor , be realised by\r\ndeducting the amount from the compensation money payable to such intermediary.\r\nIt, therefore, provides an additional mode of recovery for realisation of the\r\ndues. The word 'may' in S. 6 (e) clearly indicates that the Government has the\r\noption to fall back upon the compensation amount. It does not entail in the\r\nconsequence that the mode indicated in S. 6 (e) is the one and the only mode\r\navailable.\" Indu Bhushan \r\nGupta v. State of U.P.
