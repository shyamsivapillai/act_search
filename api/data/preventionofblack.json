The right provided under the Act has, therefore, to be treated as\r\nan extension of the constitutional right already available to a  detenu under Article 22(5). The legislature has, in fact,\r\ngiven effect to the constitutional right by providing in Section 8 of the Act\r\nthat the detenu shall have the right\u00a0 of making\r\na representation to the appropriate government.
