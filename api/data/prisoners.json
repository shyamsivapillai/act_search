Power for officers in charge of prisons to give\r\neffect to sentences or certain Courts\n(1) Officers in charge of prisons outside the Presidency-town\r\nmay give effect to any sentence or order or warrant for the detention of any\r\nperson passed or issued-(a) by any Court or tribunal acting, whether\r\nwithin the States under the general or special authority of the Central\r\nGovernment, or of the Government of Burma, or by any Court or tribunal, which\r\nwas before the commencement of the constitution acting under the general or\r\nspecial authority of His Majesty, or of the Crown Representative; or(b) before the 26th January, 1950, by any\r\nCourt or tribunal in any Indian State-(i) if the presiding Judge, or if the Court or\r\ntribunal consisted of two or more Judges, at least one of the Judges, was an\r\nofficer of the Crown authorized to sit as such Judge by the State or the Ruler\r\nthereof or by the Central Government or the Crown Representative; and(ii) if the reception, detention or\r\nimprisonment in any Province of India of person sentenced by any such Court or\r\ntribunal had been authorized by general or special order by the State\r\nGovernment; or(c) by any other Court or tribunal in a Part B\r\nwith the previous sanction of the State Government in the case of each such\r\nsentence, order or warrant:Provided that\r\neffect shall not be given to any sentence order or warrant for detention passed\r\nor issued by any Court or tribunal in Burma without the previous sanction of\r\nthe State Government concerned.(2) Where a Court or tribunal of such an Indian State as\r\naforesaid has passed a sentence which could not have been executed without the\r\noccurrence of an officer of the Crown, and such sentence had been considered on\r\nthe merits and confirmed by any such officer specially authorized in that\r\nbehalf, such sentence, and nay order or warrant issued in pursuance thereof,\r\nshall be deemed to be sentence, order or warrant of a Court or tribunal acting\r\nunder the authority of the Central Government or the Crown Representative.]Comment: To give effect to the sentence means that it\r\nis illegal to exceed it and so it follows that a prison official who goes\r\nbeyond mere imprisonment or deprivation of locomotion and assaults or otherwise\r\ncompels the doing of things not covered by the sentence acts in violation of\r\nArt. 19. Punishments of rigorous imprisonment oblige the inmates to do hard\r\nlabor, not harsh labor and so a vindictive officer victimizing a prisoner by\r\nforcing on him particularly harsh and degrading jobs, vocatives the law's\r\nmandate. For example, a prisoner, if forced to carry night soil, may seek a\r\nhabeas writ. 'Hard labor' in S.53 has to receive a humane meaning. A girl\r\nstudent or a male weakling sentenced to rigorous imprisonment may not be forced\r\nto break stones for nine hours a day. The prisoner cannot demand soft jobs but\r\nmay reasonably be assigned congenial jobs. Sense and sympathy are not enemies\r\nof penal asylums. Sunil Batra, Petitioner v.
