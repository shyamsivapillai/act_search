The Section merely\r\nrequires occupation of any public premises. Entry into possession connotes one\r\nsingle terminus, viz., the point of time when a person enters into possession\r\nor occupies the property whereas occupation is a continuous process which\r\nstarts right from the point of time when the person enters into possession or\r\noccupies the premises and continues, until he leaves the premises. What is\r\ngermane for the purpose of interpretation of Section 2\u00a0 (2) (g) is whether\r\nor not the person concerned was in occupation of the public premises when the\r\nPremises Act was passed\u201d\u00a0 M/s.
