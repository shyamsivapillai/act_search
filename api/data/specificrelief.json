It is true that the\r\nsuit was not filed within six months under Section 6 of the Specific Relief\r\nAct. But, as seen earlier, the proceedings under S.145 were initiated at the\r\ninstance of the respondent Ram Gopal and were pending for long time until the\r\nrevision was dismissed by the High Court giving liberty to the appellant to\r\nfile the suit for possession. Under these circumstances, the suit came to be\r\nfiled immediately after the proceedings came to a terminus, no doubt, after\r\nissue of notice to the Government under Section 80 CPC and after expiry of 60\r\ndays time required under S.80 CPC.
